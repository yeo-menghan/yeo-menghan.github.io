Troubleshooting the deployment issue (502 Bad Gateway).
We will be making a switch from Elastic Beanstalk to EC2 to unwrap the abstractions which may be the cause of this error

Explain: Beanstalk vs ECS vs Cloudformations

TODO
- Understanding the tradeoffs between using AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Cloudformations
- Reading more deeply into Github Actions and AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Documenting readme for the project
- BONUS: switch up the data and model training to be something more useful
