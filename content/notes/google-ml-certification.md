## Introduction

I worked on this certification as part of the AISG's Level 3 certification. I took around 6 months to go through the GCP materials. Thereafter, I took 1 month of intensive study to prepare for the final exam. However, there's a much more optimised way to go about studying for this exam.

## Resources

I've found 2 essential resources in preparation for this exam.

This book: [Google Cloud Certified Professional Machine Learning Engineer Study Guide](https://www.amazon.sg/Certified-Professional-Machine-Learning-Engineer/dp/1119944465/ref=asc_df_1119944465?mcid=fb37d99d62413482ab16ad351333f0c6&tag=googleshoppin-22&linkCode=df0&hvadid=692618114775&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=7382683559034918829&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9062499&hvtargid=pla-1722274532320&psc=1&gad_source=1)

and this quizzing website: [leetquiz](https://www.leetquiz.com/certificate/google-professional-machine-learning-engineer/practice)

The book contain both study materials as well as short quizzes at the end of each chapter. I realise that the best way to prepare for this exam (which is in MCQ format) is to spam quizzing instead of obsessing over going through the study materials on GCP. Nevertheless, the GCP material is still worth going through to build practical knowedge. The issue is the phrasing of the questions for the quiz. The questions on leetquiz made up around 70% of the questions asked during the actual exam.

## Personal Notes

You can refer to my notion page for all the notes I've made: [notion](https://www.notion.so/Google-Cloud-Machine-Learning-Engineer-Certification-1bfde17f026a80ab8fe9e5566cffb697?source=copy_link)

## Personal Advice on passing the exam

I believe the exam revision can be completed within 1 month:
1. Go through Google Cloud Certified Professional ML Engineer Study Guide quickly (1 week)
2. Review Practical courses on GCP for the portions where you need greater intuition of the interface
3. Grind leetquiz for the duration of their trial period
4. Complete the certification's sample questions
5. Compile a question bank from the book, leetquiz and the sample questions - compare your intuitive answer to the expected answer - ask why?

## Final Thoughts

The exam is very much theoretical and the practical aspect of the learning resources is only supplementary. Nevertheless, it is still important to complete the practical course and use GCP to build projects for your own understanding and learning.

Good luck! The exam was fun.
