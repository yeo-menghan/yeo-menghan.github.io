I recently came across a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@bhatadithya54764118/my-journey-through-100-days-of-machine-learning-lessons-beyond-algorithms-b63770473864) on completing *100 days of Machine Learning*, and it struck a chord with me. Not because it promised mastery in a fixed timeframe, but because it emphasized something far more important: **discipline**. That’s what I want to build this year (2026)

Over the next 100 days, I’m committing to showing up daily to learn and build in the ML/AI space. My focus will be on three pillars:  
- **Foundations & concepts** - revisiting core ML ideas and understanding *why* things work  
- **Research exposure** - reading papers, summaries, and implementations to stay grounded in real-world progress  
- **Hands-on projects** - practical implementations, even if they’re tutorial-based  

I’m not chasing novelty. I’m chasing **depth and consistency**.

One personal rule I’m setting for myself: every project will include a **“community bonus”** section. This is where I’ll reflect on how the idea, technique, or system could be applied to problems that matter to my community - whether that’s education, accessibility, public services, or local decision-making. Even hypothetical links count, as long as the thinking is intentional.

My long-term goal is to become a <mark>stronger ML engineer</mark> - someone who can reason deeply about models, data, and trade-offs - and eventually work on problems with direct, positive impact. This 100-day challenge is a small but deliberate step in that direction.

I don’t expect perfection. I do expect progress.

Day 1 starts now.
