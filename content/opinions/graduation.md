Graduated with a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from NUS under the Engineering Scholars Program (completing a 4-year program in 3 years), I'm about to begin my Masters in Data Science and Machine Learning. As a new semester begins, it's time to reflect on the past three years.

## Pre-University: National Service & Deciding My Path

After serving two years of NS—first at command school (SCS), then as a 3rd Sergeant in 41SAR—I had time to consider my university major. Options included Business, Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science. I chose Computer Engineering for its intersection of EE and CS, and because of my background in robotics.

I also weighed NUS’s Engineering Scholars (Escholars) program against NTU’s REP. NUS won out for its flexibility in masters selection and focus on engineering.

Advance Placement Credit Exams (CS1010, MA2001, and MA1505) were a humbling experience: only passing CS1010 made me rethink my study methods. University learning demands adaptability and depth.

### Early Courses Cleared

- CS1010 — Programming Methodology 1
- EG1311 — Design and Make (intensive 2-week version for scholars)

## Year 1: Foundations & Community

### Semester 1

Despite years of robotics, I struggled with foundational modules and programming, but benefited greatly from collaborative friends. The RC4 on-campus experience was transformative—late-night sports, shared meals, and new friendships.

**Courses Cleared:**
- CFG1002 — Career Catalyst
- CG1111A — Engineering Principles and Practice 1
- CS1231 — Discrete Structures
- CS2040C — Data Structures and Algorithms (C++)
- MA1511 — Engineering Calculus
- MA1512 — Differential Equations for Engineering
- PF1101 — Fundamentals of Project Management
- UTC1702E — Thinking in Systems: Energy Systems

**Winter School:**  
Attended Korea University, clearing IWC207 (Statistics), and traveled through Busan, Jeonju, and Seoul.

### Semester 2

The arrival of ChatGPT 3.5 changed study habits, but over-reliance hurt my fundamentals and grades. I also took on the role of Project Director for NUS Computing Club’s LifeHack 2023, learning hard lessons in time and energy management.

**Courses Cleared:**
- CG2111A — Engineering Principles and Practice II
- DTK1234 — Design Thinking
- EE2026 — Digital Design
- EG2101 — Pathways to Engineering Leadership
- GEA1000 — Quantitative Reasoning with Data
- MA1508E — Linear Algebra for Engineering
- UTC2700 — An Undefeated Mind: An Experiential Inner Reengineering Approach
- UTW1001D — Self, Society, And The Digital Tsunami Era

**Summer:**  
Non-credit Robotics Engineer Intern at DSTA.  
Took CP2106 (Orbital).

## Year 2: Pushing Limits & New Directions

### Semester 1

This was my most intense semester—38 MCs—packed with technical modules. Highlights included founding the ‘NUS AI Thinking’ club and co-organizing an AI hackathon with the NUS IEEE Student Club. I also contributed to a project building smart glasses for the visually impaired.

**Courses Cleared:**
- CFG1003 — Financial Wellbeing Intro
- CFG1004 — Financial Wellbeing — Art and Science of Investing
- CG2027 — Transistor-Level Digital Circuits
- CG2028 — Computer Organisation
- CG2271 — Real-Time Operating System
- CS2113 — Software Eng. & OOP
- EE2211 — Introduction to Machine Learning
- EE3801 — Data Engineering Principles
- EG2605 — Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme
- EG2701A — Aspirational Project I
- UTS2711 — Religion, Governance and Policymaking in Singapore

**Key Lessons:**  
Hardware headaches (CG2271 racing car debacles) convinced me to focus more on AI and ML, enjoying modules like EE2211 and EE3801.

### Semester 2: NOC Vietnam

Originally set for NOC Israel, I spent the semester in Vietnam, gaining new perspectives on ASEAN’s growth and dynamism.

**Courses Cleared:**
- ETP2271 — Discovering Resilience and Purpose
- ET3201S — Innovation & Enterprise Internship
- ETP3204S — Innovation & Enterprise Internship Practicum
- ETP3211 — New Venture Creation
- DMX1501AI — Design Your Own Course (AISG’s Level 2)

## Year 3: Exchange, Research, and Looking Forward

### Semester 1: SEP at CUHK

Chose CUHK for its rich Data Science and Computer Science offerings, and proximity to East Asia travel.

**Courses Cleared:**
- CSCI2730 — Introduction to Blockchain
- CSCI3160 — Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- ENGG2030 — Signals and Systems
- IERG4320 — Data Science in Practice

### Semester 2: Wrapping Up

Focused on job/internship search and masters applications; awarded Dean’s List. Worked as a research assistant on a computer vision project detecting humans from fisheye images.

After deliberating between several masters options, I committed to Data Science & Machine Learning for a stronger foundational understanding.

**Courses Cleared:**
- CDE2000 — Creating Narratives
- CDE2501 — Liveable Cities
- CG4002 — Computer Engineering Capstone Project
- EE4204 — Computer Networks

**Summer:**  
Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Changi Airport Group.

## Looking Back

The last three years have made me more self-aware of my strengths, weaknesses, and aspirations. I couldn't have done this alone—thanks to friends, family, and my girlfriend for walking this journey with me.
