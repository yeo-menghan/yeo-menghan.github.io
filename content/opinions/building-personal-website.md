# Why Every Developer Should Build Their Own Website

In the age of LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter, you might wonder if a personal website is still necessary. After building this site, I can confidently say: absolutely yes.

## It's Your Digital Home

Social media platforms come and go. MySpace, Google+, and countless others have shown us that no platform is forever. Your personal website is the one piece of internet real estate you truly own.

When you build your own site, you control:
- The design and user experience
- What content appears and how it's organized
- How your work is presented
- The technical stack and features

## It's a Learning Opportunity

Building this website taught me more than I expected. Even though I work with AI and machine learning daily, web development presented unique challenges:

### Technical Skills
I learned about modern web frameworks (Next.js), server-side rendering, responsive design, and deployment pipelines. These skills complement my ML work surprisingly well.

### Design Thinking
Presenting complex technical projects in an accessible way requires careful thought about information architecture, visual hierarchy, and user experience.

### Content Creation
Writing about my projects forced me to articulate what I learned and why it matters. This clarity benefits not just visitors but also my own understanding.

## It Showcases More Than GitHub

GitHub shows your code, but a personal website shows:
- How you communicate ideas
- What you choose to highlight
- Your design sensibilities
- Your personality and interests

For my projects like the SG-English ASR system or taxi demand forecasting, I can provide context that a README file never could: why the project matters, what challenges I faced, and what I learned.

## It's Great for Networking

When meeting people at conferences or interviews, saying "check out my website at yeomenghan.com" is more professional and memorable than rattling off multiple social media handles.

Plus, you can customize it for different audiences:
- Recruiters can see your full work experience
- Researchers can dive into your technical notes
- Casual visitors can read your thoughts on industry trends

## The Tech Stack Matters Less Than You Think

I built this site with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS because that's what I'm comfortable with. But the specific technology doesn't matter as much as having something up and running.

Whether you use:
- Static site generators (Hugo, Jekyll)
- Modern frameworks (Next.js, Gatsby, Astro)
- CMS platforms (WordPress, Ghost)
- Or hand-coded HTML

What matters is that it represents you well and you maintain it.

## Start Small, Iterate Often

My first version was just an About page and a list of projects. Over time, I've added:
- Opinion articles (like this one)
- Technical notes on papers I've read
- Better organization and filtering
- An AI chatbot that can answer questions about my work

Your website can grow with you. Don't wait for it to be perfect before launching.

## The ROI is Real

Beyond the intrinsic benefits, a personal website has tangible returns:

- **Job opportunities**: Recruiters have mentioned finding my site and being impressed
- **Collaboration requests**: Other developers and researchers reach out about projects
- **Speaking invitations**: Conference organizers can see both my work and communication skills
- **Personal branding**: It establishes expertise in my areas of interest

## My Advice: Just Start

If you're a developer without a personal website:

1. Register a domain (your name, if available)
2. Choose a simple tech stack you're comfortable with
3. Start with the basics: About, Projects, Contact
4. Deploy it (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages - all have free tiers)
5. Iterate based on what you want to showcase

You don't need to build everything at once. My site evolved over months, and it continues to evolve as my interests and projects change.

## Conclusion

A personal website is more than a portfolio - it's a reflection of how you think, what you value, and how you present yourself professionally. In a world where we're all competing for attention, having a well-crafted digital presence sets you apart.

Plus, it's genuinely fun to build something that's entirely yours.

What are you waiting for? Your domain name is probably available right now.
